# MeltySynth

MeltySynth is a SoundFont synthesizer written in C#.
The purpose of this project is to provide a MIDI music playback functionality for any .NET applications without complicated dependencies.
The codebase is lightweight and can be applied to any audio drivers which support streaming audio, such as [SFML.Net](https://github.com/SFML/SFML.Net), [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET), [OpenTK](https://github.com/opentk/opentk), and [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio).

The entire code is heavily inspired by the following projects:

* [C# Synth](https://github.com/sinshu/CSharpSynthProject) by Alex Veltsistas
* [TinySoundFont](https://github.com/schellingb/TinySoundFont) by Bernhard Schelling

An example code to synthesize a simple chord:

```cs
// Create the synthesizer.
var sampleRate = 44100;
var synthesizer = new Synthesizer("TimGM6mb.sf2", sampleRate);

// Play some notes (middle C, E, G).
synthesizer.NoteOn(0, 60, 100);
synthesizer.NoteOn(0, 64, 100);
synthesizer.NoteOn(0, 67, 100);

// The output buffer (3 seconds).
var left = new float[3 * sampleRate];
var right = new float[3 * sampleRate];

// Render the waveform.
synthesizer.Render(left, right);
```

Another example code to synthesize a MIDI file:
```cs
// Create the synthesizer.
var sampleRate = 44100;
var synthesizer = new Synthesizer("TimGM6mb.sf2", sampleRate);

// Read the MIDI file.
var midiFile = new MidiFile("flourish.mid");
var sequencer = new MidiFileSequencer(synthesizer);
sequencer.Play(midiFile, false);

// The output buffer.
var left = new float[(int)(sampleRate * midiFile.Length.TotalSeconds)];
var right = new float[(int)(sampleRate * midiFile.Length.TotalSeconds)];

// Render the waveform.
sequencer.Render(left, right);
```

## Features

* No dependencies other than .NET Standard 2.1.
* No memory allocation in the rendering process.
* No unsafe code.
